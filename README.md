# matplotlib-challenge
In this challenge, I visualize and interpret data from some pharmaceutical tests to derive further meanings from the results.  These interpretations are primarily based on measures of central tendency.

There are two csv files.  One has the data on the test subjects and the other has information on their test results.

The first step is to clean the data of repeat entries.  The second is to perform a function similar to that of a Vlookup.  I take data from the mouse data csv and add an attribute to the test data csv based on the mice ID number.  The third step is a series of plots and dataframes to visualize the data of the testing samples as well as the test results.  The fourth step is creating a scatterplot and a linear regression line to show the correlation of a particular medication and how it affects the test subjects
